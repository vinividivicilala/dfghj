			<p>
				Welcome to PointLinePlane, plpxyz for short. I‚Äôm Brandon, for over 20 years I've been a developer, designer, and technology educator. You'll see content here discussing UX Engineering, Design Systems, DesignOps, career advice, working with clients and stakeholders, and development considerations from freelance projects to enterprise organizations - with a handful of dad-jokes and mild-takes added to the mix.
